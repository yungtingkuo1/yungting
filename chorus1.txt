I can feel the sunshine in my life
I'm just a little happier by your side
Hold my hand when I need you the most
It's your love that is weighted in gold
I can feel the sunshine in my life
I'm just a little happier by your side
Hold my hand when I need you the most
It's your love that is weighted in gold, weighted in gold
Weighted in gold
It's your love that is weighted in gold, weighted in gold
