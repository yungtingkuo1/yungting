The sun leaves, and I'm waving goodbye, but these
Street lights, they still shining bright, lately
I was getting kinda used to the dark
But it never got too close to my heart (eh, ayy)
But then I saw you walk through the room, and your
Sweet eyes, they were shining through every
Little corner 'til our eyes would meet
And suddenly it's all I can see-e-e
All these complications
Lonely isolations
I can see them fade away
